      <description>In May 2021, I went through an interview process at AWS for the role of Solutions Architect. Unfortunately, I did not successfully pass the interview loop. However, I did receive good feedback about my assignment. Therefore, I would like to share my experience with you regarding this process and discuss the assignment in detail. I wonâ€™t upload the Cloud Formation template for obvious reasons, but the exercise is not complicated, and it allows you to be creative on the assignment.</description>
