      <description>In May, I was in a process interview in AWS for the role of Solutions Architects. Sadly, I did not pass successfully the loop, however I got a really good feedback about my assignment. I won&amp;rsquo;t upload the Cloud Formation fixed template for obvious reasons. However, is NOT complicated assignment, go and check ACL, SG or how health checks is configured on the ELB. This excessive is easy, so you can be creative.</description>
