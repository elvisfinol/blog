<p>A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you type and (once you hit return), translates those commands into (ultimately) system calls to the Operating System API.</p>

<p>Note: A binary is a file that contains the instructions for a program, ie it is a ‘program’ file, rather than a ‘text’ file, or an ‘application’ file (such as a Word document).</p>

<p>You only need to know that a shell program is a program that allows you to tell the computer what to do. In that way, it’s not much different to many other kinds of programming languages.</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
# First line of the script is the shebang which tells the system how to execute
# the script: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)
# As you already figured, comments start with #. Shebang is also a comment.

# Simple hello world example:
echo Hello world! # =&gt; Hello world!

# Each command starts on a new line, or after a semicolon:
echo 'This is the first line'; echo 'This is the second line'
# =&gt; This is the first line
# =&gt; This is the second line

# Declaring a variable looks like this:
Variable=&quot;Some string&quot;

# But not like this:
Variable = &quot;Some string&quot; # =&gt; returns error &quot;Variable: command not found&quot;
# Bash will decide that Variable is a command it must execute and give an error
# because it can't be found.

# Nor like this:
Variable= 'Some string' # =&gt; returns error: &quot;Some string: command not found&quot;
# Bash will decide that 'Some string' is a command it must execute and give an
# error because it can't be found. (In this case the 'Variable=' part is seen
# as a variable assignment valid only for the scope of the 'Some string'
# command.)

# Using the variable:
echo $Variable # =&gt; Some string
echo &quot;$Variable&quot; # =&gt; Some string
echo '$Variable' # =&gt; $Variable
# When you use the variable itself — assign it, export it, or else — you write
# its name without $. If you want to use the variable's value, you should use $.
# Note that ' (single quote) won't expand the variables!

# Parameter expansion ${ }:
echo ${Variable} # =&gt; Some string
# This is a simple usage of parameter expansion
# Parameter Expansion gets a value from a variable.
# It &quot;expands&quot; or prints the value
# During the expansion time the value or parameter can be modified
# Below are other modifications that add onto this expansion

# String substitution in variables
echo ${Variable/Some/A} # =&gt; A string
# This will substitute the first occurrence of &quot;Some&quot; with &quot;A&quot;

# Substring from a variable
Length=7
echo ${Variable:0:Length} # =&gt; Some st
# This will return only the first 7 characters of the value
echo ${Variable: -5} # =&gt; tring
# This will return the last 5 characters (note the space before -5)

# String length
echo ${#Variable} # =&gt; 11

# Indirect expansion
OtherVariable=&quot;Variable&quot;
echo ${!OtherVariable} # =&gt; Some String
# This will expand the value of OtherVariable

# Default value for variable
echo ${Foo:-&quot;DefaultValueIfFooIsMissingOrEmpty&quot;}
# =&gt; DefaultValueIfFooIsMissingOrEmpty
# This works for null (Foo=) and empty string (Foo=&quot;&quot;); zero (Foo=0) returns 0.
# Note that it only returns default value and doesn't change variable value.

# Declare an array with 6 elements
array0=(one two three four five six)
# Print first element
echo $array0 # =&gt; &quot;one&quot;
# Print first element
echo ${array0[0]} # =&gt; &quot;one&quot;
# Print all elements
echo ${array0[@]} # =&gt; &quot;one two three four five six&quot;
# Print number of elements
echo ${#array0[@]} # =&gt; &quot;6&quot;
# Print number of characters in third element
echo ${#array0[2]} # =&gt; &quot;5&quot;
# Print 2 elements starting from forth
echo ${array0[@]:3:2} # =&gt; &quot;four five&quot;
# Print all elements. Each of them on new line.
for i in &quot;${array0[@]}&quot;; do
    echo &quot;$i&quot;
done

# Brace Expansion { }
# Used to generate arbitrary strings
echo {1..10} # =&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
echo {a..z} # =&gt; a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
# This will output the range from the start value to the end value

# Built-in variables:
# There are some useful built-in variables, like
echo &quot;Last program's return value: $?&quot;
echo &quot;Script's PID: $$&quot;
echo &quot;Number of arguments passed to script: $#&quot;
echo &quot;All arguments passed to script: $@&quot;
echo &quot;Script's arguments separated into different variables: $1 $2...&quot;

# Now that we know how to echo and use variables,
# let's learn some of the other basics of bash!

# Our current directory is available through the command `pwd`.
# `pwd` stands for &quot;print working directory&quot;.
# We can also use the built-in variable `$PWD`.
# Observe that the following are equivalent:
echo &quot;I'm in $(pwd)&quot; # execs `pwd` and interpolates output
echo &quot;I'm in $PWD&quot; # interpolates the variable

# If you get too much output in your terminal, or from a script, the command
# `clear` clears your screen
clear
# Ctrl-L also works for clearing output

# Reading a value from input:
echo &quot;What's your name?&quot;
read Name # Note that we didn't need to declare a new variable
echo Hello, $Name!

# We have the usual if structure:
# use `man test` for more info about conditionals
if [ $Name != $USER ]
then
    echo &quot;Your name isn't your username&quot;
else
    echo &quot;Your name is your username&quot;
fi
# True if the value of $Name is not equal to the current user's login username

# NOTE: if $Name is empty, bash sees the above condition as:
if [ != $USER ]
# which is invalid syntax
# so the &quot;safe&quot; way to use potentially empty variables in bash is:
if [ &quot;$Name&quot; != $USER ] ...
# which, when $Name is empty, is seen by bash as:
if [ &quot;&quot; != $USER ] ...
# which works as expected

# There is also conditional execution
echo &quot;Always executed&quot; || echo &quot;Only executed if first command fails&quot;
# =&gt; Always executed
echo &quot;Always executed&quot; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Only executed if first command does NOT fail&quot;
# =&gt; Always executed
# =&gt; Only executed if first command does NOT fail


# To use &amp;&amp; and || with if statements, you need multiple pairs of square brackets:
if [ &quot;$Name&quot; == &quot;Steve&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$Age&quot; -eq 15 ]
then
    echo &quot;This will run if $Name is Steve AND $Age is 15.&quot;
fi

if [ &quot;$Name&quot; == &quot;Daniya&quot; ] || [ &quot;$Name&quot; == &quot;Zach&quot; ]
then
    echo &quot;This will run if $Name is Daniya OR Zach.&quot;
fi

# There is also the `=~` operator, which tests a string against a Regex pattern:
Email=me@example.com
if [[ &quot;$Email&quot; =~ [a-z]+@[a-z]{2,}\.(com|net|org) ]]
then
    echo &quot;Valid email!&quot;
fi
# Note that =~ only works within double [[ ]] square brackets,
# which are subtly different from single [ ].
# See https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Conditional-Constructs for more on this.

# Redefine command `ping` as alias to send only 5 packets
alias ping='ping -c 5'
# Escape the alias and use command with this name instead
\ping 192.168.1.1
# Print all aliases
alias -p

# Expressions are denoted with the following format:
echo $(( 10 + 5 )) # =&gt; 15

# Unlike other programming languages, bash is a shell so it works in the context
# of a current directory. You can list files and directories in the current
# directory with the ls command:
ls # Lists the files and subdirectories contained in the current directory

# This command has options that control its execution:
ls -l # Lists every file and directory on a separate line
ls -t # Sorts the directory contents by last-modified date (descending)
ls -R # Recursively `ls` this directory and all of its subdirectories

# Results of the previous command can be passed to the next command as input.
# The `grep` command filters the input with provided patterns.
# That's how we can list .txt files in the current directory:
ls -l | grep &quot;\.txt&quot;

# Use `cat` to print files to stdout:
cat file.txt

# We can also read the file using `cat`:
Contents=$(cat file.txt)
# &quot;\n&quot; prints a new line character
# &quot;-e&quot; to interpret the newline escape characters as escape characters
echo -e &quot;START OF FILE\n$Contents\nEND OF FILE&quot;
# =&gt; START OF FILE
# =&gt; [contents of file.txt]
# =&gt; END OF FILE

# Use `cp` to copy files or directories from one place to another.
# `cp` creates NEW versions of the sources,
# so editing the copy won't affect the original (and vice versa).
# Note that it will overwrite the destination if it already exists.
cp srcFile.txt clone.txt
cp -r srcDirectory/ dst/ # recursively copy

# Look into `scp` or `sftp` if you plan on exchanging files between computers.
# `scp` behaves very similarly to `cp`.
# `sftp` is more interactive.

# Use `mv` to move files or directories from one place to another.
# `mv` is similar to `cp`, but it deletes the source.
# `mv` is also useful for renaming files!
mv s0urc3.txt dst.txt # sorry, l33t hackers...

# Since bash works in the context of a current directory, you might want to
# run your command in some other directory. We have cd for changing location:
cd ~    # change to home directory
cd      # also goes to home directory
cd ..   # go up one directory
        # (^^say, from /home/username/Downloads to /home/username)
cd /home/username/Documents   # change to specified directory
cd ~/Documents/..    # still in home directory..isn't it??
cd -    # change to last directory
# =&gt; /home/username/Documents

# Use subshells to work across directories
(echo &quot;First, I'm here: $PWD&quot;) &amp;&amp; (cd someDir; echo &quot;Then, I'm here: $PWD&quot;)
pwd # still in first directory

# Use `mkdir` to create new directories.
mkdir myNewDir
# The `-p` flag causes new intermediate directories to be created as necessary.
mkdir -p myNewDir/with/intermediate/directories
# if the intermediate directories didn't already exist, running the above
# command without the `-p` flag would return an error

# You can redirect command input and output (stdin, stdout, and stderr).
# Read from stdin until ^EOF$ and overwrite hello.py with the lines
# between &quot;EOF&quot;:
cat &gt; hello.py &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/usr/bin/env python
from __future__ import print_function
import sys
print(&quot;#stdout&quot;, file=sys.stdout)
print(&quot;#stderr&quot;, file=sys.stderr)
for line in sys.stdin:
    print(line, file=sys.stdout)
EOF
# Variables will be expanded if the first &quot;EOF&quot; is not quoted

# Run the hello.py Python script with various stdin, stdout, and
# stderr redirections:
python hello.py &lt; &quot;input.in&quot; # pass input.in as input to the script

python hello.py &gt; &quot;output.out&quot; # redirect output from the script to output.out

python hello.py 2&gt; &quot;error.err&quot; # redirect error output to error.err

python hello.py &gt; &quot;output-and-error.log&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1
# redirect both output and errors to output-and-error.log

python hello.py &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
# redirect all output and errors to the black hole, /dev/null, i.e., no output

# The output error will overwrite the file if it exists,
# if you want to append instead, use &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;:
python hello.py &gt;&gt; &quot;output.out&quot; 2&gt;&gt; &quot;error.err&quot;

# Overwrite output.out, append to error.err, and count lines:
info bash 'Basic Shell Features' 'Redirections' &gt; output.out 2&gt;&gt; error.err
wc -l output.out error.err

# Run a command and print its file descriptor (e.g. /dev/fd/123)
# see: man fd
echo &lt;(echo &quot;#helloworld&quot;)

# Overwrite output.out with &quot;#helloworld&quot;:
cat &gt; output.out &lt;(echo &quot;#helloworld&quot;)
echo &quot;#helloworld&quot; &gt; output.out
echo &quot;#helloworld&quot; | cat &gt; output.out
echo &quot;#helloworld&quot; | tee output.out &gt;/dev/null

# Cleanup temporary files verbosely (add '-i' for interactive)
# WARNING: `rm` commands cannot be undone
rm -v output.out error.err output-and-error.log
rm -r tempDir/ # recursively delete
# You can install the `trash-cli` Python package to have `trash`
# which puts files in the system trash and doesn't delete them directly
# see https://pypi.org/project/trash-cli/ if you want to be careful

# Commands can be substituted within other commands using $( ):
# The following command displays the number of files and directories in the
# current directory.
echo &quot;There are $(ls | wc -l) items here.&quot;

# The same can be done using backticks `` but they can't be nested -
# the preferred way is to use $( ).
echo &quot;There are `ls | wc -l` items here.&quot;

# Bash uses a `case` statement that works similarly to switch in Java and C++:
case &quot;$Variable&quot; in
    # List patterns for the conditions you want to meet
    0) echo &quot;There is a zero.&quot;;;
    1) echo &quot;There is a one.&quot;;;
    *) echo &quot;It is not null.&quot;;;  # match everything
esac

# `for` loops iterate for as many arguments given:
# The contents of $Variable is printed three times.
for Variable in {1..3}
do
    echo &quot;$Variable&quot;
done
# =&gt; 1
# =&gt; 2
# =&gt; 3


# Or write it the &quot;traditional for loop&quot; way:
for ((a=1; a &lt;= 3; a++))
do
    echo $a
done
# =&gt; 1
# =&gt; 2
# =&gt; 3

# They can also be used to act on files..
# This will run the command `cat` on file1 and file2
for Variable in file1 file2
do
    cat &quot;$Variable&quot;
done

# ..or the output from a command
# This will `cat` the output from `ls`.
for Output in $(ls)
do
    cat &quot;$Output&quot;
done

# Bash can also accept patterns, like this to `cat`
# all the Markdown files in current directory
for Output in ./*.markdown
do
    cat &quot;$Output&quot;
done

# while loop:
while [ true ]
do
    echo &quot;loop body here...&quot;
    break
done
# =&gt; loop body here...

# You can also define functions
# Definition:
function foo ()
{
    echo &quot;Arguments work just like script arguments: $@&quot;
    echo &quot;And: $1 $2...&quot;
    echo &quot;This is a function&quot;
    return 0
}
# Call the function `foo` with two arguments, arg1 and arg2:
foo arg1 arg2
# =&gt; Arguments work just like script arguments: arg1 arg2
# =&gt; And: arg1 arg2...
# =&gt; This is a function

# or simply
bar ()
{
    echo &quot;Another way to declare functions!&quot;
    return 0
}
# Call the function `bar` with no arguments:
bar # =&gt; Another way to declare functions!

# Calling your function
foo &quot;My name is&quot; $Name

# There are a lot of useful commands you should learn:
# prints last 10 lines of file.txt
tail -n 10 file.txt

# prints first 10 lines of file.txt
head -n 10 file.txt

# sort file.txt's lines
sort file.txt

# report or omit repeated lines, with -d it reports them
uniq -d file.txt

# prints only the first column before the ',' character
cut -d ',' -f 1 file.txt

# replaces every occurrence of 'okay' with 'great' in file.txt
# (regex compatible)
sed -i 's/okay/great/g' file.txt
# be aware that this -i flag means that file.txt will be changed
# -i or --in-place erase the input file (use --in-place=.backup to keep a back-up)

# print to stdout all lines of file.txt which match some regex
# The example prints lines which begin with &quot;foo&quot; and end in &quot;bar&quot;
grep &quot;^foo.*bar$&quot; file.txt

# pass the option &quot;-c&quot; to instead print the number of lines matching the regex
grep -c &quot;^foo.*bar$&quot; file.txt

# Other useful options are:
grep -r &quot;^foo.*bar$&quot; someDir/ # recursively `grep`
grep -n &quot;^foo.*bar$&quot; file.txt # give line numbers
grep -rI &quot;^foo.*bar$&quot; someDir/ # recursively `grep`, but ignore binary files

# perform the same initial search, but filter out the lines containing &quot;baz&quot;
grep &quot;^foo.*bar$&quot; file.txt | grep -v &quot;baz&quot;

# if you literally want to search for the string,
# and not the regex, use `fgrep` (or `grep -F`)
fgrep &quot;foobar&quot; file.txt

# The `trap` command allows you to execute a command whenever your script
# receives a signal. Here, `trap` will execute `rm` if it receives any of the
# three listed signals.
trap &quot;rm $TEMP_FILE; exit&quot; SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM

# `sudo` is used to perform commands as the superuser
# usually it will ask interactively the password of superuser
NAME1=$(whoami)
NAME2=$(sudo whoami)
echo &quot;Was $NAME1, then became more powerful $NAME2&quot;
